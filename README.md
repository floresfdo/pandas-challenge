Data Bootcamp Pandas Homework

PyCitySchools/main.ipynb

Script that analyzes school performance on a given district. 
Reading csv files and using pandas dataframes to analyze data at different levels.
Student and school data is merged, grouped and parsed in different levels to understand student/school performance (in math and reading).
Also provides an overall view of top performing, lower performing, school sizing, budget and type.

By looking at the analysis we can determine that Charter schools are usually better performing, meaning that a higher % of their students pass both math and reading.
On the other side of the spectrum are District schools, where all 5 bottom performing schools were district schools.
Something interesting is that schools with the lowest spending ranges (per student) were the best performing schools; and larger schools tend to do worse, significantly worse in both subjects.
